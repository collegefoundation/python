# Write a python program to split a given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is gigen
# Length of first part 3


list = [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,1]
first_part = list[0:3]
second_part = list[3:8]
print(f"First Part of List:  {first_part}" )
print(f"First Part of List:  {second_part}")



# Output
#First Part of List:  [1, 1, 2]
#First Part of List:  [3, 4, 4, 5, 1]
